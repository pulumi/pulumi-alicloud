/**
 * Provides a ECS Deployment Set resource.
 *
 * For information about ECS Deployment Set and how to use it, see [What is Deployment Set](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/doc-detail/91269.htm).
 *
 * > **NOTE:** Available since v1.140.0.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * Basic Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as alicloud from "@pulumi/alicloud";
 *
 * const config = new pulumi.Config();
 * const name = config.get("name") || "terraform-example";
 * const _default = new alicloud.ecs.EcsDeploymentSet("default", {
 *     strategy: "Availability",
 *     deploymentSetName: name,
 *     description: name,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ECS Deployment Set can be imported using the id, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import alicloud:ecs/ecsDeploymentSet:EcsDeploymentSet example <id>
 * ```
