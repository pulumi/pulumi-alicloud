/**
 * Provides a RAM Group membership resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as alicloud from "@pulumi/alicloud";
 *
 * // Create a RAM Group membership.
 * const group = new alicloud.ram.Group("group", {
 *     comments: "this is a group comments.",
 *     force: true,
 * });
 * const user = new alicloud.ram.User("user", {
 *     displayName: "user_display_name",
 *     mobile: "86-18688888888",
 *     email: "hello.uuu@aaa.com",
 *     comments: "yoyoyo",
 *     force: true,
 * });
 * const user1 = new alicloud.ram.User("user1", {
 *     displayName: "user_display_name1",

 *     email: "hello.uuu@aaa.com",
 *     comments: "yoyoyo",
 *     force: true,
 * });
 * const membership = new alicloud.ram.GroupMembership("membership", {

 *     userNames: [
 *         user.name,
 *         user1.name,
