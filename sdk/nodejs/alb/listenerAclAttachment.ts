/**
 * Provides a ALB Listener Acl Attachment resource. Associating ACL to listening.
 *
 * For information about ALB Listener Acl Attachment and how to use it, see [What is Listener Acl Attachment](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/slb/application-load-balancer/developer-reference/api-alb-2020-06-16-associateaclswithlistener).
 *
 * > **NOTE:** Available since v1.163.0.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** You can associate at most three ACLs with a listener.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** You can only configure either a whitelist or a blacklist for listener, not at the same time.
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ALB Listener Acl Attachment can be imported using the id, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import alicloud:alb/listenerAclAttachment:ListenerAclAttachment example <listener_id>:<acl_id>
 * ```
