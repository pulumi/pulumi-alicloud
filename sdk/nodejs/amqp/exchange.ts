/**
 * Provides a RabbitMQ (AMQP) Exchange resource.
 *
 * For information about RabbitMQ (AMQP) Exchange and how to use it, see [What is Exchange](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/message-queue-for-rabbitmq/latest/createexchange).
 *
 * > **NOTE:** Available since v1.128.0.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * Basic Usage
 *
 * <!--Start PulumiCodeChooser -->
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as alicloud from "@pulumi/alicloud";
 *
 * const _default = new alicloud.amqp.Instance("default", {
 *     instanceType: "professional",
 *     maxTps: "1000",
 *     queueCapacity: "50",
 *     supportEip: true,
 *     maxEipTps: "128",
 *     paymentType: "Subscription",
 *     period: 1,
 * });
 * const defaultVirtualHost = new alicloud.amqp.VirtualHost("default", {
 *     instanceId: _default.id,
 *     virtualHostName: "tf-example",
 * });
 * const defaultExchange = new alicloud.amqp.Exchange("default", {
 *     autoDeleteState: false,
 *     exchangeName: "tf-example",
 *     exchangeType: "DIRECT",
 *     instanceId: _default.id,
 *     internal: false,
 *     virtualHostName: defaultVirtualHost.virtualHostName,
 * });
 * ```
 * <!--End PulumiCodeChooser -->
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * RabbitMQ (AMQP) Exchange can be imported using the id, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import alicloud:amqp/exchange:Exchange example <instance_id>:<virtual_host_name>:<exchange_name>
 * ```
