/**
 * Provides an ONS instance resource.
 *
 * For more information about how to use it, see [RocketMQ Instance Management API](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/106354.html).
 *
 * > **NOTE:** The number of instances in the same region cannot exceed 8. At present, the resource does not support region "mq-internet-access" and "ap-southeast-5".
 *
 * > **NOTE:** Available in 1.51.0+
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * Basic Usage
 *
 * <!--Start PulumiCodeChooser -->
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as alicloud from "@pulumi/alicloud";
 * import * as random from "@pulumi/random";
 *
 * const config = new pulumi.Config();
 * const name = config.get("name") || "tf-example";
 * const _default = new random.index.Integer("default", {
 *     min: 10000,
 *     max: 99999,
 * });
 * const example = new alicloud.rocketmq.Instance("example", {
 *     instanceName: `${name}-${_default.result}`,
 *     remark: name,
 * });
 * ```
 * <!--End PulumiCodeChooser -->
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ONS INSTANCE can be imported using the id, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import alicloud:rocketmq/instance:Instance instance MQ_INST_1234567890_Baso1234567
 * ```
