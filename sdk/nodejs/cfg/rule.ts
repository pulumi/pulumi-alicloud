/**
 * Provides a Config Rule resource.
 *
 * For information about Config Rule and how to use it, see [What is Rule](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/cloud-config/latest/api-config-2020-09-07-createconfigrule).
 *
 * > **NOTE:** Available since v1.204.0.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * Basic Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as alicloud from "@pulumi/alicloud";
 *
 * const _default = alicloud.resourcemanager.getResourceGroups({
 *     status: "OK",
 * });
 * const defaultRule = new alicloud.cfg.Rule("default", {
 *     description: "If the resource matches one of the specified tag key-value pairs, the configuration is considered compliant.",
 *     sourceOwner: "ALIYUN",
 *     sourceIdentifier: "contains-tag",
 *     riskLevel: 1,
 *     tagValueScope: "example-value",
 *     tagKeyScope: "example-key",
 *     excludeResourceIdsScope: "example-resource_id",
 *     regionIdsScope: "cn-hangzhou",
 *     configRuleTriggerTypes: "ConfigurationItemChangeNotification",
 *     resourceGroupIdsScope: _default.then(_default => _default.ids?.[0]),
 *     resourceTypesScopes: ["ACS::RDS::DBInstance"],
 *     ruleName: "contains-tag",
 *     inputParameters: {
 *         key1: "value1",
 *         key2: "value2",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Config Rule can be imported using the id, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import alicloud:cfg/rule:Rule example <id>
 * ```
