     * The execution time of the scheduled execution command. Currently, three scheduled execution methods are supported: fixed interval execution (based on Rate expression), only once at a specified time, and timed execution based on clock (based on Cron expression).
     * - Fixed time interval execution: Based on the Rate expression, the command is executed at the set time interval. Time intervals can be selected by seconds (s), minutes (m), hours (h), and days (d), which is suitable for scenarios where tasks are executed at fixed time intervals. The format is rate( ). If the execution is performed every 5 minutes, the format is rate(5m). Executing with a fixed time interval has the following limitations:
     * - The set time interval is no more than 7 days and no less than 60 seconds, and must be greater than the timeout period of the scheduled task.
     * - The execution interval is based only on a fixed frequency, independent of the time the task actually takes to execute. For example, if the command is executed every 5 minutes and the task takes 2 minutes to complete, the next round will be executed 3 minutes after the task is completed.
     * - The task is not executed immediately when it is created. For example, if a command is executed every 5 minutes, the command is not executed immediately when a task is created, but is executed 5 minutes after the task is created.
     * - Execute only once at the specified time: Execute the command once according to the set time zone and execution time point. The format is at(yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss ), that is, at (year-month-day time: minute: Second ). If you do not specify a time zone, the default is the UTC time zone. Time zones can be in the following three formats: the full name of the time zone, such as Asia/Shanghai (China/Shanghai time), America/los_angles (United States/Los Angeles time), and so on. The offset of the time zone relative to Greenwich Mean Time: E.G. GMT +8:00 (East Zone 8), GMT-7 (West Zone 7), etc. When using the GMT format, the hour bit does not support adding leading zeros. Time zone abbreviation: Only UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) is supported.
     * If it is specified to be executed once 13:15:30 June 06, 2022, China/Shanghai time, the format is at (Asia/Shanghai, 2022-06-06 13:15:30); If it is specified to be executed once 13:15:30 June 06, 2022, the format is at(2022-06-06 13:15:30 GMT-7:00).
     * - Timing based on clock (based on Cron expression): Based on Cron expression, commands are executed according to the set timing task. The format is        , that is,  . In the specified time zone, calculate the execution time of the scheduled task based on the Cron expression and execute it. If no time zone is specified, the default time zone is the internal time zone of the scheduled task instance. For more information about Cron expressions, see Cron Expressions. Time zones support the following three forms:
     * - Full time zone name: such as Asia/Shanghai (China/Shanghai time), America/los_angles (US/Los Angeles time), etc.
     * - The offset of the time zone relative to Greenwich Mean Time: E.G. GMT +8:00 (East Zone 8), GMT-7 (West Zone 7), etc. When using the GMT format, the hour bit does not support adding leading zeros.
     * - Time zone abbreviation: Only UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) is supported.
     *
     * For example, in China/Shanghai time, the command will be executed once every day at 10:15 am in 2022 in the format 0 15 10? * * 2022 Asia/Shanghai; In the eastern 8th District time, it will be executed every half hour from 10:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. every day in 2022, in the format of 0 0/30 10-11 * *? 2022 GMT +8:00; In UTC time, starting from 2022, it will be executed every 5 minutes from 14:00 P.M. to 14:55 p. M. Every two years in October, in the format of 0 0/5 14*10? 2022/2 UTC.

     * - Timing based on clock (based on Cron expression): Based on Cron expression, commands are executed according to the set timing task. The format is        , that is,  . In the specified time zone, calculate the execution time of the scheduled task based on the Cron expression and execute it. If no time zone is specified, the default time zone is the internal time zone of the scheduled task instance. For more information about Cron expressions, see Cron Expressions. Time zones support the following three forms:
     * - Full time zone name: such as Asia/Shanghai (China/Shanghai time), America/los_angles (US/Los Angeles time), etc.
     * - The offset of the time zone relative to Greenwich Mean Time: E.G. GMT +8:00 (East Zone 8), GMT-7 (West Zone 7), etc. When using the GMT format, the hour bit does not support adding leading zeros.
     * - Time zone abbreviation: Only UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) is supported.
     *
     * For example, in China/Shanghai time, the command will be executed once every day at 10:15 am in 2022 in the format 0 15 10? * * 2022 Asia/Shanghai; In the eastern 8th District time, it will be executed every half hour from 10:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. every day in 2022, in the format of 0 0/30 10-11 * *? 2022 GMT +8:00; In UTC time, starting from 2022, it will be executed every 5 minutes from 14:00 P.M. to 14:55 p. M. Every two years in October, in the format of 0 0/5 14*10? 2022/2 UTC.
