 *
 * Basic Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as alicloud from "@pulumi/alicloud";
 *
 * const example = new alicloud.ddos.DomainResource("example", {
 *     domain: "tftestacc1234.abc",
 *     httpsExt: "{\"Http2\":1,\"Http2https\":0，\"Https2http\":0}",
 *     instanceIds: ["ddoscoo-cn-6ja1rl4j****"],
 *     proxyTypes: [{
 *         proxyPorts: [443],
 *         proxyType: "https",
 *     }],
 *     realServers: ["177.167.32.11"],
 *     rsType: 0,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Anti-DDoS Pro Domain Resource can be imported using the id, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import alicloud:ddos/domainResource:DomainResource example <domain>
 * ```
