        /// - Fixed time interval execution: Based on the Rate expression, the command is executed at the set time interval. Time intervals can be selected by seconds (s), minutes (m), hours (h), and days (d), which is suitable for scenarios where tasks are executed at fixed time intervals. The format is rate( ). If the execution is performed every 5 minutes, the format is rate(5m). Executing with a fixed time interval has the following limitations:
        /// - The set time interval is no more than 7 days and no less than 60 seconds, and must be greater than the timeout period of the scheduled task.
        /// - The execution interval is based only on a fixed frequency, independent of the time the task actually takes to execute. For example, if the command is executed every 5 minutes and the task takes 2 minutes to complete, the next round will be executed 3 minutes after the task is completed.
        /// - The task is not executed immediately when it is created. For example, if a command is executed every 5 minutes, the command is not executed immediately when a task is created, but is executed 5 minutes after the task is created.
        /// - Execute only once at the specified time: Execute the command once according to the set time zone and execution time point. The format is at(yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss ), that is, at (year-month-day time: minute: Second ). If you do not specify a time zone, the default is the UTC time zone.

The offset of the time zone relative to Greenwich Mean Time: E.G. GMT +8:00 (East Zone 8), GMT-7 (West Zone 7), etc. When using the GMT format, the hour bit does not support adding leading zeros. Time zone abbreviation: Only UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) is supported.
        /// If it is specified to be executed once 13:15:30 June 06, 2022, China/Shanghai time, the format is at (Asia/Shanghai, 2022-06-06 13:15:30); If it is specified to be executed once 13:15:30 June 06, 2022, the format is at(2022-06-06 13:15:30 GMT-7:00).
