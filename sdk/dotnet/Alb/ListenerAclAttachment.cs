    /// Provides a ALB Listener Acl Attachment resource. Associating ACL to listening.
    /// 
    /// For information about ALB Listener Acl Attachment and how to use it, see [What is Listener Acl Attachment](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/server-load-balancer/latest/associateaclswithlistener).
    /// 
    /// &gt; **NOTE:** Available since v1.163.0.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **NOTE:** You can associate at most three ACLs with a listener.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **NOTE:** You can only configure either a whitelist or a blacklist for listener, not at the same time.

    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// ALB Listener Acl Attachment can be imported using the id, e.g.
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    ///  $ pulumi import alicloud:alb/listenerAclAttachment:ListenerAclAttachment example &lt;listener_id&gt;:&lt;acl_id&gt;
