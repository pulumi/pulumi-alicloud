    /// Provides a a Alicloud Config Rule resource. Cloud Config checks the validity of resources based on rules. You can create rules to evaluate resources as needed.
    /// For information about Alicloud Config Rule and how to use it, see [What is Alicloud Config Rule](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/154216.html).
    /// 
    /// &gt; **NOTE:** Available in v1.99.0+.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **NOTE:** The Cloud Config region only support `cn-shanghai` and `ap-southeast-1`.
    /// 
    /// &gt; **NOTE:** If you use custom rules, you need to create your own rule functions in advance. Please refer to the link for [Create a custom rule.](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/doc-detail/127405.htm)
