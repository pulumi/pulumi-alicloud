For details, see [Storage Encryption](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/maxcompute/security-and-compliance/storage-encryption)&gt; **NOTE :**:To enable storage encryption, you need to modify the parameters of the basic attributes of the MaxCompute project. This operation permission is authenticated by RAM, and you need to have the Super_Administrator role permission of the corresponding project.To configure the permissions and IP whitelist parameters of the MaxCompute project, you must have the management permissions (Admin) of the corresponding project, including Super_Administrator, Admin, or custom management permissions. For more information, see the project management permissions list.You can turn on storage encryption only for projects that have not turned on storage encryption. For projects that have turned on storage encryption, you cannot turn off storage encryption or change the encryption algorithm.
