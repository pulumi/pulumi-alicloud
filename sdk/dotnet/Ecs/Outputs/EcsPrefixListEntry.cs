        /// * CIDR block types are determined by the IP address family. You cannot combine `IPv4` and `IPv6` CIDR blocks in a single entry.
        /// * CIDR blocks must be unique across all entries in a prefix list. For example, you cannot specify 192.168.1.0/24 twice in the entries of the prefix list.
        /// * IP addresses are supported. The system converts IP addresses into CIDR blocks. For example, if you specify 192.168.1.100, the system converts it into the 192.168.1.100/32 CIDR block.
        /// * If an IPv6 CIDR block is used, the system converts it to the zero compression format and changes uppercase letters into lowercase ones. For example, if you specify 2001:0DB8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/32, the system converts it into 2001:db8::/32.
